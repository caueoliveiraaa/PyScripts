1 - Simple Class Creation: Create a class Person with attributes name and age.
Initialize these attributes using the __init__ method.

2 - Class Method Usage: Add a method greet to the Person class that prints a greeting message.

3 - Magic Method Usage: Implement the __str__ method in the Person class to return a string
representation of the object.

4 - Operator Overloading: Implement the __add__ method in a class Vector to
perform vector addition.

5 - Inheritance: Create a class Employee that inherits from the Person class
and add an attribute salary.

6 - Polymorphism: Override the greet method in the Employee class to include
their salary in the greeting.

7 - Property Decorators: Use property decorators to create getter and
setter methods for the salary attribute in the Employee class.

8 - Class Variables vs Instance Variables: Explore the difference between
class variables and instance variables.

9 - Private Variables: Implement private variables in a class and understand
their usage.

10 - Dunder Methods: Implement and understand various other dunder methods
like __len__, __getitem__, etc.

11 - Metaclass Creation: Create a simple metaclass and use it to create a class.

12 - Singleton Using Metaclass: Implement a singleton pattern using a metaclass.

13 - Abstract Base Classes: Use the abc module to create an abstract base class
and understand its usage.

14 - Multiple Inheritance: Create classes showcasing multiple inheritance and
understand the Method Resolution Order (MRO).

15 - Mixins: Understand the concept of Mixins and implement it in Python classes.

16 - Class Decorators: Create a decorator for a class and understand its usage.

17 - Static Methods vs Class Methods: Understand the difference between static methods
and class methods, implement both.

18 - Context Managers Using Classes: Implement a context manager using classes.

19 - Descriptors: Understand descriptors and implement them in a class.

20 - Metaclass vs Class Decorators: Understand the difference between
metaclasses and class decorators, when to use which.

21 - Simple Decorator**: Create a simple decorator that prints a message
before and after the execution of a function.

22 - Decorator with Arguments**: Create a decorator that takes arguments.

23 - Chaining Decorators**: Apply multiple decorators to a single function.

24 - Class Method Decorator**: Create a decorator for a class method.

25 - Decorator for Class**: Create a decorator that can be applied to a class.

26 - Memoization Using Decorators**: Implement memoization (caching)
using decorators.

27 - Context Manager**: Implement a context manager using the
`with` statement.

28 - Context Manager as a Decorator**: Use a context manager as a decorator.

29 - Nested Context Managers**: Use nested context managers in a single
`with` statement.

30 - Exception Handling in Context Managers**: Handle exceptions within
a context manager's block.

31 - Simple Generator**: Create a simple generator function that yields values.

32 - Generator Expression**: Use a generator expression to create a generator.

33 - Chaining Generators**: Chain multiple generators together in a
single function.

34 - Generators with Context Managers**: Use a generator with a context
manager to manage resources.

35 - Coroutines with Generators**: Use generators to implement
coroutines(asymmetric routines).

36 - Implementing Decorators with Classes**: Implement decorators using
classes instead of functions.

37 - Implementing Generators with Classes**: Implement generators using classes
by defining the `__iter__` and `__next__` methods.

38 - Generator-based Context Manager**: Implement a context manager using
a generator-based approach with the `contextlib` module's `@contextmanager` decorator.

39 - Decorators in Flask Routes**: If you're familiar with Flask, practice
using decorators in defining routes for a Flask application.

40 - Decorators in Django Views**: If you're familiar with Django, practice using
decorators in Django views for things like login_required and user_passes_test.
